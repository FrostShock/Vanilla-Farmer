Useful stuff for Vanilla WoW farming

The "MapNotes.lua" file contains the locations of many rare mobs and vendors that sell green items or recipes or potions. It also contains the Un'Goro Devilsaur routes and various points of interest.

The "Gatherer.lua" file contains the locations of many treasure chests

The "bindings-cache.wtf" contains a very good choice of key bindings.
